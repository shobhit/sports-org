1. Register players, coaches, volunteers, etc.
2. Define playing and practicing venues and times.
3. Define multiple leagues that might have muliple divisions with teams. Define the age groups from the league.
4. Define the roster of the teams.
5. Define and/or automatically generate schedules based on the teams and venue availability.
6. Keep up with team records and standings.
